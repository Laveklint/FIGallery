Image Gallery : vanilla js image gallery which takes advantage of css3 transitions and transforms
for all animation.

Yeoman: if you have yeoman installed you can hit up "yeoman server".
Yeoman test: run "yeoman server:test" to see mocha chai expect bdd test

Due to use of css3 transitions and transform the gallery doens't work in  < IE10.
Works like a charm and in and tested in the following browsers:
Chrome (PC)
Chrome Canary (PC)
Internet Explorer 10
Firefox (PC)
Safari iOS

- Routing
- Touch navigation for mobile

Should be fixed:
- remove lodash.js dependency

Dependencies:

Use of external resources:
- lodash.js
- Paul Irish requestAnimation shim
